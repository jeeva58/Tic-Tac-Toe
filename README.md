# Tic Tac Toe Game

### Description:
In this app we will be building a Tic Tac Toe Game Project using Java and XML in
Android. The Tic Tac Toe Game is based on a two-player game. Each player
chooses between X and O. Player play one move at a time simultaneously. In a
move, a player can choose any position from a 3×3 grid.
The goal here is to get three consecutive X or O in a horizontal, vertical, or
diagonal direction. There will be a single activity in this application. This activity
will show a 3×3 grid. The status of the game will be displayed at the bottom.

### Features:
1. The game provides the player with options to either play alone or with some
other players. If the singleplayer option is selected, the game is played against
the computer.
2. The player's turn after each move can be seen.
3. The game can be restarted for the players using the
restart button
4. The players are alerted if any one of the players win or if the game is a draw.
5. The app’s UI has a three-by-three grid with nine cells. The playet can only
put their symbol in a cell that doesn’t contain any character.
